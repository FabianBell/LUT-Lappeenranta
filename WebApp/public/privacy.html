				<p style="color:grey;font-size:100%" > Our idea of the usage of your data is that we only want to know something about the devices that are out in the world.
														We do not want to know anything about you, your family, your money, or anything that is not related to the device. 
														This means you do not have to worry about us saving any data and selling it so someone else. 
														<br> <br> The main focus is on sustainablity and to help you keep your receipts at one place. Maybe we can open the eyes 
														of the companies so they change their devices in order to make them live longer but let us be realistic, we just started with this project.
														<br> <br> First you can log in as an anonymous user. Here you can see the statistics but obviously can not save any devices. 
														For saving your devices you have to sign up. You can either use your google account, another e-mail adress, or if you want to stay anonymous you 
														have the opportunity to create a username and a password without using your e-mail adress. 
														After signing in you can save devices and view the statistics. If you make a fault report that one of your 
														devices broke no one will see your name or anything related to your profile on the fault reports but they will be pulished on the page of 
														the statistics. The reason for that
														is that other user can now see which parts of a device are maybe common to break and think about buying a different model instead. 
														The only things that are saved with your fault report are the model and the brand of your device, the life time of your device and the 
														answers to the questions that are asked in the fault report.  
														Furthermore the fault reports will not be deleted at anytime. If you want to delete your device we will not 
														save any of the informtation of the device, except the fault report. But this is very important because we need the fault reports to fill 
														our statistics. The more devices break the more data we get and the statistics will get more meaningful. If you delete your whole profile 
														it is basically the same. The only things that will not be deleted are the fault reports. 
														<br> <br> In order to have all your receipts at one place there is the possibility to save a receipt to each device you save. You can either 
														directly make a picture of the receipt or upload a picture from your galary. If you saved a picture of a receipt with a device you can 
														access the picture at any time and download it to your galary. By deleting your device we will automatically delete the associated receipt 
														as well. </center>
