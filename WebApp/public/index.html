				<center> <p style="color:grey;text-align:justify,center;font-size:150%" ><b>Hey there! <br>Welcome to our page!</b> </p>
				<center> <p style="color:grey;text-align:justify,center;font-size:100%" >Do you know which companies do actually care about you and which do only care about the money they get? <br> 
													No? Well, then stay tuned!</p>
				<center> <p style="color:grey;text-align:justify,center;font-size:100%" > But first we would like to tell you our story. <br> This Application is 
													a project for a course at our university. It is supposed to support sustainability in a way that we want companies to make 
													their products last longer. Some do speak of planned obsolescence. The competition is big but the huge companies still can 
													do what they want because the consumers will never know if their devices broke because they were old or if they broke because 
													the company planned it in advance. There is nothing we can do to get the answer except for sharing our experiences with everyone 
													and support the companies that really care about us and our environment. </p>
				<center> <p style="color:grey;text-align:justify,center;font-size:100%" >The idea was that you can save all of your 
													devices to have an overview of the devices you have. The App saves the brand, model, price, date of purchase, condition in 
													which the device was bought, and additionally it saves a picture of the receipt so you do not have to go through everything 
													you own just to get the receipt and check if the garanty is still valid. If a device broke you can make a fault report so 
													the other users can see what part of your device broke and the reason for that. You can also add if the device was repaired 
													and if the garanty took care of it. Your data will be saved in an anonimous way so no one can see that you actually made 
													the fault report, even we can not see that you made it. The Fault reports help us to create statistics of the broken devices, 
													to see if there actually are devices that break after a specific time at a specific part. Of course you also benefit from this 
													because the next time you buy a new laptop for example you can see if there are already some users that have bad experiences 
													with a spesific model and you will always know where you have your receipts! We hope that you will have fun with the app
													and spread the intention of it because when everyone helps the companies may start caring about us and the environment and 
													not only their money. </p>
